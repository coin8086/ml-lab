TODO:

* How to load in run.py a model trained by run_ddp.py? That is, how to load a model trained by DDP, for inferencing? Is it still necessary to create a DDP wrapper around the original model?
* How to do container based training (with/without DDP)?
* Add long names for arguments of command line.
